# Hacker News reading client

> This project overview is designed for everyone who wants to implement it. It should help more in app development.

Design an web interface for reading Hacker News, backed up by Hacker News API.

## Goal

The goal of this application for you is to practice creating UIs using more **advanced UI building technologies**. Because you will use official Hacker News API you can only focus on client side of the application.

## Specification

Develop an application using JavaScript, HTML/CSS and React.js.

Please apply concepts and new features from the last lecture: single-page app design, JavaScript History API, infinite scroll, CSS/JS animation, declarative interface logic.

1. **API**: fetch data from [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

2. **Rendering**: render all HN data using JavaScript/React.js.

3. **Styling**: style website using component framework (e.g. Bootstrap).
    - look and feel (UI desing) can be made simmilar to official website
    - style with Bootstrap because it is faster than plain CSS

4. **Extra features**: implement additional website features.

But my real goal is to try everything from lecture 6:
1. Single-page app
2. JavaScript history API
3. Infinite window scroll
4. CSS/JS animation
5. React.js library
6. Bootstrap (components/utilities/layout)
